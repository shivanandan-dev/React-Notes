## **Learnings**
### **React Essential - Deep Dive**
- [Fragments `<></>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment)

- Refs
    - [Refs and the DOM](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs#refs-and-the-dom)
    - [Mastering React's useRef Hook: Why it Doesn't Trigger Re-renders and How it Persists Across Re-renders](https://dev.to/samabaasi/mastering-useref-why-it-doesnt-trigger-re-renders-and-how-it-persists-across-re-renders-1l2b)
        - [Important: Consistency across renders](https://dev.to/samabaasi/mastering-useref-why-it-doesnt-trigger-re-renders-and-how-it-persists-across-re-renders-1l2b#:~:text=Consistency%20Across%20Renders)

    - [`useImperativeHandle` Hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useImperativeHandle)
- [`createPortal`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal)
- Component Composition
- Prop Drilling and How to overcome?
    - [Prop Drilling](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
    - [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#context-an-alternative-to-passing-props)
    - Context Consumer
    - Outsourcing context and state into a seperate provider component
- [`useReducer`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
- `useEffects()`
    - [What is react side effects?](https://medium.com/@remoteupskill/what-is-a-react-side-effect-a5525129d251)
    - [What is side-effect in ReactJS and how to handle it?](https://dev.to/hellonehha/what-is-side-effect-in-reactjs-and-how-to-handle-it-39j8)
        - Importants: Omit dependency array, Blank dependency array, Value in dependency array, cleanup.
    - A potential problem with side effects: an infinite loop.
    - Not all side effect needs `useEffect()`
        - When the side effect is inside a function.
        - When the side effect is used by user interaction.
        - When the side effect doesn't lead to infinte loop or infinite re-rendering when a state is updated in the side effect.
        - > **NOTE**: `useEffect()` is only needed when there is infinite loop or infinite re-rendering during the state update.
    - Remember when `useEffect()` is used the sideeffects run only after the rendering completes. So `useEffect()` is used when the side effect is needed to be executed after the rendering part.
    - [useEffect Cleanup](https://refine.dev/blog/useeffect-cleanup/#web-sockets)
    - The problem with Object and Function Dependencies.
    - The `useCallback()` hook

    - Data Fetching and HTTP Request
        - Do not connect database directly using react as the credential can be compromised as the code is exposed to the users.
            - Instead use backend and fetch the data using (REST) API.
        - `async` and `await` is not allowed for component functions.
        - Using `fetch` directly in the component will re-render as the state changes when trying to populate the data. This will lead to a infinite loop.
